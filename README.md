
# CRUD API with Express JS

This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API built using Express.js, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. It incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and role-based authorization to ensure secure access control to resources.

## Features 
* **CRUD Operations:** Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing resources.
* **MVC Design Pattern:** Organizes the codebase into separate modules for Models, Views, and Controllers, enhancing code maintainability and scalability.
* **JWT Authentication:** Implements authentication using JSON Web Tokens, allowing users to obtain access tokens upon successful login and verifying the token for subsequent requests.
* **Role-Based Authorization:** Enforces role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to specific endpoints based on user roles, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
